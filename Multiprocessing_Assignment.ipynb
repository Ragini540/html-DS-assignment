        "Differences Between Multiprocessing and Multithreading:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Concept**:\n",
        "   - Multiprocessing: Uses multiple processes, each with its own memory space and Python interpreter. Achieves true parallelism, ideal for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "   - Multithreading: Uses multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space. Best for I/O-bound tasks but limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Memory and Resources**:\n",
        "   - Multiprocessing: Each process has its own memory space, offering isolation but higher memory consumption.\n",
        "   - Multithreading: Threads share the same memory space, making them memory efficient but susceptible to data corruption (race conditions).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Performance (Parallelism)**:\n",
        "   - Multiprocessing: Provides true parallelism, ideal for CPU-bound tasks, as each process can run on a separate CPU core.\n",
        "   - Multithreading: Limited by the GIL for CPU-bound tasks, better for I/O-bound tasks where threads spend time waiting for external resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Overhead**:\n",
        "   - Multiprocessing: Higher overhead due to separate processes, memory allocation, and slower inter-process communication.\n",
        "   - Multithreading: Lower overhead as threads share memory, but synchronization mechanisms are needed for shared resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Fault Isolation**:\n",
        "   - Multiprocessing: Processes are isolated, so a failure in one process doesn't affect others, offering better fault tolerance.\n",
        "   - Multithreading: Threads share memory, so a crash in one thread can affect the entire program, making it less fault-tolerant.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Suitability for Tasks**:\n",
        "   - Multiprocessing: Best for CPU-bound tasks like scientific computing, data processing, image/video processing, and machine learning.\n",
        "   - Multithreading: Best for I/O-bound tasks like web scraping, file operations, network communication, and database queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Ease of Use**:\n",
        "   - Multiprocessing: More complex to set up due to process management, inter-process communication, and memory isolation.\n",
        "   - Multithreading: Easier to set up and use, especially for tasks involving concurrency, with available synchronization tools like Locks and Semaphores."
