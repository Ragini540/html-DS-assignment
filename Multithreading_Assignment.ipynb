        "Advantages\n",
        "- **Improved Performance in I/O-bound Tasks**: Multithreading enhances performance for tasks waiting on I/O operations (e.g., file reading, network requests) by allowing other threads to work while one is blocked.  \n",
        "  *Example*: A web scraper using multiple threads to send HTTP requests concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Better CPU Utilization for I/O-bound Workloads**: Multithreading enables better use of CPU resources when waiting for I/O, as multiple threads can work in parallel without blocking the entire program.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Responsiveness**: In programs with user interfaces (UIs), multithreading ensures the main thread remains responsive while background tasks run in separate threads.  \n",
        "  *Example*: In a media player, one thread handles UI rendering while another handles media playback.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Concurrency**: Multithreading allows multiple threads to run independently, ideal for tasks like handling multiple user requests or parallel data processing.  \n",
        "  *Example*: A web server processing requests from multiple clients concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Resource Sharing**: Threads share the same memory space, making it easier to communicate and share resources like variables and data structures.  \n",
        "  *Example*: A multithreaded database application accessing a shared database cache.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages\n",
        "- **Complexity in Design and Debugging**: Multithreaded programs are more complex to design and debug due to issues like race conditions, deadlocks, and synchronization challenges.  \n",
        "  *Example*: Race conditions can occur if threads access shared data without proper synchronization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Concurrency Issues**: Issues like race conditions, deadlocks, and livelocks arise when threads interfere with each other, requiring careful synchronization to avoid them.  \n",
        "  *Example*: Deadlock occurs when two threads wait for each other to release resources, freezing the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Increased Memory Overhead**: Each thread requires its own stack space, leading to higher memory consumption when managing many threads, which can impact performance.  \n",
        "  *Example*: A web server with thousands of threads for concurrent connections may consume excessive memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Difficulty in Achieving True Parallelism (due to GIL)**: The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python prevents true parallel execution of CPU-bound tasks, limiting the benefits of multithreading for such tasks.  \n",
        "  *Example*: CPU-heavy tasks like matrix multiplication are bottlenecked by the GIL in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Context Switching Overhead**: Frequent context switching between threads can reduce performance, especially with a large number of threads.  \n",
        "  *Example*: With thousands of threads, the overhead of switching between them may outweigh the execution time.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Harder to Scale for CPU-bound Tasks**: Multithreading may not be effective for CPU-bound tasks due to the GIL. Using multiprocessing (separate processes) can offer better performance.  \n",
        "  *Example*: Heavy computations in Python may benefit more from multiprocessing than multithreading.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Increased Risk of Bugs**: Bugs like race conditions or deadlocks can be hard to reproduce and fix due to the non-deterministic behavior of multithreaded programs.  \n",
        "  *Example*: Data corruption may occur when threads try to update shared resources simultaneously, but the bug may not always happen due to unpredictable thread execution order."
